    <p>Version control keeps track of all your progress and also allows multiple people to work on the same script with out stepping on each others toes. If you break something version control can take you bake and time travel in your script to when it was all okay. When you work with people you can use version control to help be like "This one is mine i'm gonna work on it. And that, thats yours you work on it" and when your both done you can tell git while you sit in front of your lap top. "Git i command you now make these two a one!" and gits all like 'i is not a git command see some help'. 'git merge [bookmark]/[branch]' is the right one all joking aside. GitHub now knows who you are and when your working with a team your commits pulls merges etc. they are all tracked. Don't understand a new piece of code or who did it? GitHub does! Need some help with a thing? Not only do you have the GitHub community where someone has probably worked on the same problem as you but you also have your team to chat with on GitHub and members of the community who like deep shades of green on their contributions map. </p>
    <p> Github is a social coding website that allows developer to share their code and keep track of changes using git. Github is a platform to push on the changes you made locally in your computer using git to a remote repository in Github. Everyone who is working on the same project able to see the changes you made using Github and also you are able to merge your files together to a common final repository.</p>

-What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  <head></head> - Because you need it to house the metadata and things like title
  <title></title> - Because its better then having the file name in the tab bar.
  <ul><li></li></ul> - Because lists are handy dandy for all the things!
  <body></body> - Because you can't have a head with no body :D... But really its because thats where the majority of the HTML goes
  <main></main> - Shows makes it easy to find the main part of the file.
  <article></article> - I use this often because it shows there is a lot of text here.
  <p></p> -Because text needs to go in a paragraph
  <hr> - Because i like horizontal lines.
  <footer></footer> - (Because you cant go any where with out your feet) This doesn't really change from page to page and house things like licenses contact info or even recommended articles if its a blog. So I've used this a lot to keep the main stuff separate from what goes at the bottom of the page.

-How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
From top to bottom of the file.
-What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
Oh defiantly will make more snippets, thats really useful! I'm defiantly going to go through the shortcuts and see whats useful. especially when we get into ruby.
