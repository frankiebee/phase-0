**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**
You can have live editing to see where things get moved to and control the css with out having to go through the rigmarole of actually changing the source code. It would also be good for testing elements of your css.

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

You can change it in the little item display in the menu bar or you can temporarily change the dimensions with css.

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did
you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

-Absolute: Puts it exactly where you want it but removes it from the flow of elements
-Fixed: Positioned relative to the view point.
-Static: default of page element.
-Relative: Used to position relative from its regular position.

They all maid sense. None were hard to use. Relative was the easiest though.

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

-The margin is the space between the element and the edge of the browser.
-The border is the line around the element.
-The padding is th dimensions of the element

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

I kind of loved it. It was fun for awhile then i got a little board once the novelty of changing things in browser wore off. After that it was still a lot of learning. But i think I'm just not to big on the whole design thing.
