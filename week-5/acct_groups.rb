*** Reflection***
Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
Yes i do feel as if i have gotten better at writing pseudo code.

Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
I'm not sure how to answer this question what exactly are you referencing in this question?

What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
Both a hash and an array because both would have different uses.

What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
I did not re-factor this solution as i wish to move on now. I already have spent a lot of time making the print_prety and needed to time box my self on this one.
