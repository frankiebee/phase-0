1.1 Think About Time

Given that i had read some of these articles before hand I decided to use my time to learn about flow and the "fogg method" as well as read the brief intro to "Time boxing". I enjoyed reading about the fogg method and watching the video. The concept being that rather then just being motivated around the bigger picture you should focus on creating little habits that will help achieve the bigger picture. Changing your behavior to produce the outcome with many behavioral triggers by immediately celebrating success. The way this looks when this practice is written out is :"After I  _______, I will ________. Awesome :) ". For example I plan on using this during phase 0 and it will look some thing like this: "After completing a short module, I will have a chocolate chip. Chocolate is delicious" or "After I complete a short, medium and long module, I will take a 20 minute walk about." so on and so on, making habits and celebrating my efforts.

"Time boxing" is having a set time in which you continuously work until time is up. At this point the work that has been achieved is evaluated. The "Pomodoro method" is an example of "Time boxing". Although inherently useful my personal preference is not to interrupt a flow when i have one. Within my own learning practices i only use this method when it is hard to get motivated about a subject or if my rewards system is not working for me on that day.

My overall plan and current work strategy is to get most of my work done in the morning. Take notes that i can be proud of. While pushing and motivation is good allowing my sell some decompression time is important as well. And try to have fun learning. My ideal Bullet-point day style for Phase 0:

9 am coffee and create goal/todo sheet for the next 4 to 5 hours
Break todo sheet into estimated times and do what ever will take the longest first.
When i notice focus is slipping or when i am having trouble figuring something out allow for some mental rest.
Notes should be pretty and easy to read. So major points and key ideas should be copied over to the "BIG BOOK OF MIXED NOTES"
Self testing is important. Ideas and notes and vocab. words from the previous day will be self tested in the morning and notes and so on from the current day will be tested and gone over before going to bed that night.
