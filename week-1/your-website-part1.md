***Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Okay you want to make a repository on GitHub ay?
So here's what im going to need you to do:
Go ahead and login if you dont have account your going to neeed to create one. Once you have done that you're going to see a '+' sighn with a little down arrow next to your Profile icon. It will be at the top right cornner. Go aheead and click that, a tiny menue will extend from it I want you to click 'New Repository' once you have done that it will take you to a new page With the header "Create a new repository". Now fill out the required fields and choose MIT license in license. And create your repository by clicking on the bright green "Create repository" button. Once all of that is done
it will take you to your repository page. Under the red border line will be a link with HTTPS next to it. Coppy the link and then press the command button on your key board and the space bar together to bring up spotlight search. Type terminal in your spotlight and open up your terminal. Type in git clone and then paste your link it may ask you for your user name and password just type your git user name and password in and congrats you created and cloned a repository!
***Describe what open source means.
Open source means that you have and can play with the source code. and that its free to play with given the licence guide lines. But its free and usualy composed of many peoples code who are doing it for the community not the money.
***What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Thats cool is probably the extent of my oppinion. Its to early for me to have a strong oppintion on it either way. But i understand the concept and appricate its purpose in allowing fredome it what you can see in code.
***Assess the importance of using licenses.
Different licenses mean different things and its important to know what licenses your using. They are your rights with your code. And how your code is used and distrubted who gets to use it and weather or not it can be used and manipulated by other people.
***What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I think i figured branches although still a little bit of a mystery to me. I guess i strugled with this reflection explaning how to make repositorys again is really tough for me. I get why reflecting on it so that it solidfies in my head. But it does take a lot of time to type it all out. My reflections alreay take about 20 min to do at least. I understand the material im just not supper stoked about writing so many reflections. It really eats into my work flow. This was really my biggest struggle.
***Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
