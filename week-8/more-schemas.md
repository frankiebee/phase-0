####Reflection:
**What is a one-to-one database?**
When one table points to another table with one foreign key.

**When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you
**created).**
When you only have one repetitive general column. Or when two tables have a single relationship to each other.

**What is a many-to-many database?**
When many tables share a relation to each other.

**When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example
**you created).**
When you have many sub categories of a thing; like how dogs have many breads and sizes. Or how fish have many sizes, specious, colors, characteristics, names, and my personal favorite recipes.

**What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?**
The way the link and why only a foreign key can be linked only by id.
