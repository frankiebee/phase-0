#Numbers and letters reflection

```Ruby
# disclaimer: how many hours in a calender year vs how many hours in an
#actual year are different. 1 actual year is 8765.81277 hours vs 1 calender #year has 8760 hours.
a = 365 * 24 #hours in a year
b = 366 * 24 #hours in a leap year

puts "There are #{a} hours in a year, #{b} in a leap year. A decade with no leap years has #{a * 60**2 * 10} seconds, but no decade has no leap years so... A decade with 1 leap year has #{(a * 60**2 * 9)+(b * 60**2)} seconds. A decade with 2 leap years has #{(a * 60**2 * 8)+(b * 60**2 *2)} seconds and a decade with 3 leap years has #{(a * 60**2 * 7)+(b * 60**2 * 3)} seconds. "
```

**What does puts do?**

Prints to the console with a new line.

**What is an integer? What is a float?**

Integers are whole numbers and floats are numbers with floating point decimals. So 5 is an integer and 5.0 is a float.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
